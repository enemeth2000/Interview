	An interview by Ethan Nemeth

<h2>
	Why do you want to be a designer?
</h2>

<p>
	I want to be a designer because I have always enjoyed art and design, and I find myself getting passionate and interested by design every day, and I want to have a career in something I feel passionate about. 
</p>

<h2>
	What worries you about being a designer?
</h2>

<p>
	I worry that sometimes messages and ideas are unfortunately not properly conveyed, and/or they are taken out of context to have an alternate meaning aside from what the designer(s) originally intended, which may have negative consequences. 
	</p>

<h2>
	What excites you about design?
	</h2>

<p>
	The ability to create a lasting impression on people, and to create meaningful imagery that impacts people. Expressing myself in a visial manner and using my passion to create is also exciting to me when it comes to design. 
</p>

<h2>
	What aspect of design do you gravitate towards the most?
</h2>

<p>
	The fact that I can take my love of art and design and apply it in both create and technical ways in order to create something with meaning, and something that speaks to people and gets their attention.
</p>

<h2>
	What role or responsibility does a designer play in our society?
</h2>

<p>
	Designers, in my opinion, have a responsibility to create thoughtful designs, while also keeping in mind the various different factors, such as the audience, the effects of their designs, if it is truly effective design, or simply one that looks appealing, as well as how it may be perceived by others. 
</p>

<h2>
	What is a website?
</h2>

<p>
	A website, in general terms, is a page, or pages on the internet that displays data or informatiton.
</p>

<h2>
	Can design change the world?
</h2>

<p>
	In many ways it already has, so I beleive so yes. Things like road signs, public transportation signs, health and safety symbols, various iconic branding systems and company logos etc. have become so common in everyday life, it's almost hard to thimk how different the world would be without them. 
</p>

<h2>
	What is difficult or frusterating for you within design and how do you work to push past that?
</h2>

<p>
	Often I find myself getting frusterated about trying to properly convey a certain message, while also keeping the information visually appealing. This can be especially difficult when dealing with strict branding rules, where you largely cannot deviate outside of what already exists.
</p>

<h2>
	What do you see yourself doing after you finish this program?
</h2>

<p>
	I see myself hopefully working at a design studio or design firm, and working with teams of designers on various types of projects and assignments.
